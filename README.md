# EDUBRIDGE

 Engineering students today face a significant gap between academic learning and the real-world expectations of top tech MNCs. While industries rapidly evolve with new tools, technologies, and hiring trends, students continue to rely on static textbooks, lengthy PDFs, and traditional learning methods that often feel overwhelming, monotonous, and disconnected from industry needs. This results in low engagement, high cognitive load, and reduced job readiness across multiple engineering domains.

To address this challenge, EduBridge is designed as an AI-powered skilling platform that bridges the gap between current engineering students and industry-relevant tools, technologies, and trends. The platform provides domain-specific learning support through features such as AI Mentors, Notes Converter, Industry Lab Guides, Skill Gap Analysis, Smart Timetables, Mock Interviews, Peer Matching, and MNC Trend insights, enabling students to follow a structured, career-oriented learning path.


EduBridge leverages locally integrated Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and intelligent AI agents to personalize learning, convert complex study materials into simplified notes, and provide real-time guidance without relying on external cloud dependencies. To ensure responsible AI usage and data security, the platform is designed to incorporate AI Guardians and evaluation mechanisms (evals), creating a safe, reliable, and trustworthy learning environment.

Recognizing that students often lose motivation when dealing with long PDFs and dense content, EduBridge transforms static materials into interactive and engaging learning experiences. Through gamified elements such as quizzes, challenges, and interactive activities, the platform helps shift students’ learning mindset, reduce mental fatigue, and make learning enjoyable rather than burdensome.

By reducing cognitive overload, increasing engagement, and aligning education with real industry expectations, EduBridge empowers engineering students to learn faster, stay motivated, and become truly industry-ready professionals across various engineering domains.

Understanding that students often feel overwhelmed by lengthy PDFs and traditional learning materials, our platform transforms static content into engaging, interactive experiences. Instead of forcing continuous reading, we help students shift their mindset through gamified learning—using quizzes, challenges, and interactive games—so learning feels lighter, more engaging, and more effective.

## Run locally

- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- Run development server (Vite / HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Build and serve production bundle (static server):

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The production server listens on `PORT` (default `3000`).

Why EduBridge Stands Out:



EduBridge isn’t just another learning platform — it is a smart industry-connection engine where:

Students learn exactly what companies need today.

AI mentors reduce dependency on physical infrastructure or faculty expertise.

Companies gain verified, skill-mapped talent directly from campuses.

Colleges gain complete visibility into student progress and placements.

EduBridge transforms traditional engineering education into future-ready, industry-ready learning.
